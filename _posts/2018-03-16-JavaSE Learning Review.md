Becuase of preparing the tech interview for my first job, I have to start review all points which might be asked. Firstly , JavaSE is the basic part of (java)web application development, thus I tend to go through the whole points at the beginning...

## oop VS pop

Oop stands for 'Object Orientated Programming', Pop stands for 'Procedural Orientated Programming'
As for pop, program is divided into small parts called functions, and follows `Top Down approach`. The importance is not given to data but to functions as well as `sequence` of actions to be done.But in pop, overloading is not possible.Meanwhile, pop does not have any proper way for hiding data so it is less secure.
As for oop, program is divided into parts called objects, and follows `Bottom Up approach`.The importance is given to the data rather than procedures or functions because it works as a real world.Also in oop, overloading is possible in the form of Function Overloading and Operator Overloading, meanwhile it provides Data hiding so provides more security.
