##What is DOCTYPE?The difference between Quirks(compatibility) mode and Standard mode?
1. `<!DOCTYPE>`declaration must be the very first thing in your HTML document, before `<html>` to inform Browser parser what type of doc to expect.It is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the wen browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. 
if DOCTYPE no find or not correct the doc will be run based on Quirks mode. 
2. Under Standard mode, layout and js running mode are running based on the highest standard of the browser. Under Quirks mode , layout emulates nonstandard behavior in Navigator 4 and IE 5. These were needed for websites written before introduction of web standards to avoid website can not work.

##Why HTML5 only need to use `<!DOCTYPE html>`?
1. HTML5 is not based on SGML(Standard Generalized Markup Language,), thus do not require a reference to a DTD;
2. HTML4 is based on SGML,`<!DOCTYPE>`declaration refers to a DTD(Document Type Definition),The DTD specifies the rules for the markup language, so that the browsers render the content correctly.

##list several inline elements,block element,void element? what is the difference?
1. inline element: a b span img inpute select strong;
2. block element: div ul ol li dl dt dd h1 h2 h3 h4...p;
3. normal void element: <br> <hr> <img> <input> <link> <meta>; unkown element: <area> <base> <col> <command> <embed> <keygen> <param> <source> <track> <wbr>; 
Tips:
Based on CSS standard , each elements all have display property to confirm the type of element,each elements have default value of dispaly, for example: div is block as block element ,however span is inline as inlent element;

##When page inport style, the difference to use link and @import?
1. `<link>` as XHTML tag, besides loading css, can be used in defining RSS or rel connection attribute and more; but @import is provited by CSS, so only can be use loading CSS file;
2. `<link>`will be loaded when page is loading(the latter blocks parallel downloads), but as `<@import>`is inverse,it will be loaded after content loaded.
3. `<@import>`was released on css2.1,so it only can be identified above IE5, `<link>`is XHTML tag without compatibility issue;
4. `<link>`support using js control DOM to change CSS , but `<@import>`can not;

##Introduce Browser Kernel.
